# Geometry

The `geometry` module provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with geometric shapes and entities. It follows an inheritance-based design, where more complex shapes are derived from simpler ones.

## Core Concepts

The `geometry` module is organized into two main categories:

- **Continuous:** Represents shapes that are defined by continuous mathematical functions, such as circles and ellipses.
- **Discrete:** Represents shapes that are defined by a finite set of points, such as polygons and line segments.

## Available Modules

Below is a list of available modules and their functionalities:

### Continuous Geometry
