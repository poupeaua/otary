# About

Otary aims to be a complete replacement for multiple libraries for image and geometry processing tasks. You can always use the specific libraries if you need a more low-level control over the image processing pipeline.

Otary is based on top of:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/)
- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/)

Once installed and imported, Otary makes your coding journey easier and faster than ever. You can use all the functions in otary to perform multiple tasks without the need to use various libraries.
