# Contributing

## Developing

If you already cloned the [Otary repository](https://github.com/poupeaua/otary) and you want to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.

## Virtual Environment

Before contributing you will need to set up a python virtual environment.

I recommend the use of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to handle both your Python versions and your virtual environments using the extension [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

However, there are tons of other options out there. Feel free to use the one you prefer.
