# History

Otary was at the beginning only a part of a larger project in a private repository in 2024. I decided to make it public and open source in July 2025.

At the start, I was just tired of needing all the python image libraries to perform both *basic* and *specific* image processing tasks. I just wanted something that was simple to use and easy to understand.

I needed a tool that combines image processing and geometry processing, this is where the journey started.

This is how Otary was born.
