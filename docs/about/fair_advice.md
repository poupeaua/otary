# A Fair Advice

I, the author of the Otary library, want to be really fair about the use of this
framework. 

!!! quote "Robert C. Martin in the book `Clean Architecture` at page 292"
    Most frameworks authors offer their work for free because they want to be helpful
    to the community. They want to give back. This is laudable. However, regardless
    of their high-minded motives, those authors do not have your best interests at heart.
    They can't because they don't know you, and they don't know your problems.

    Framework authors know their own problems, and the problems of their coworkers and
    friends. And they write their frameworks to solve *those* problems — not yours.

    Of course, your problems will likely overlap with those other problems quite a bit.
    If this were not the case, frameworks would not be so popular. To the extent that
    such overlap exists, frameworks can be very useful indeed.

I totally agree with this. In fact, this corresponds exactly to the history of Otary.
Otary was born to solve my *personal* problems for my *personal* project. 
Otary exists because I needed something that did not exist. And I was not satisfied with what existed.

Otary was born from real-world experience: the recurring problems I faced in previous projects and the pain points my colleagues often shared.

Otary isn’t perfect, and it probably never will be, just like any real-world tool.
But it was built to solve genuine problems, and it might solve some of yours too.
I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it. Happy coding!
