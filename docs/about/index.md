## Readability

**“No comment.”**

Otary is designed so the API speaks for itself. Otary’s ultimate goal is to make you never need to write comments at all.

Like Uncle Bob says in his book *Clean Code*, if you need to write a comment you have failed to express yourself through your code.

Thus one of the main focus of Otary is to make your code as readable and easy to understand as possible.
Otary aims to provide a simple API so that *what you need* is *what you write* in your code.


## Unified library

Otary aims to be a **complete unifying library** for image and geometry processing tasks.

You can always use the specific libraries if you need a more low-level control over the image processing pipeline.

Otary is based on top of:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/)
- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
- [Scikit-Image](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [Sympy](https://sympy.org/)

Once installed and imported, Otary makes your coding journey easier and faster than ever. You can use all the functions in Otary to perform multiple tasks without the need to use various libraries.

A short-term goal would be to reduce the number of libraries Otary depends on to make the package more lightweight and more independant.

## History

Otary was at the beginning only a part of a larger project in a private repository in 2024. I decided to make it public and open source in July 2025.
