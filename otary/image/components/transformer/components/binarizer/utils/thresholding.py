    """Fast implementation of the Niblack-like thresholdings.
    These thresholdings are similar so we just put them in the same utils function.

    These thresholding methods are local thresholding methods. This means that
    the threshold value is computed for each pixel based on the pixel values
    in a window around the pixel. The window size is a parameter of the function.

    Local thresholding methods are generally better than global thresholding
    methods (like Otsu or adaptive thresholding) for images with varying
    illumination.

    It includes the following methods:
    - Niblack
    - Sauvola
    - Wolf
    - Nick
    - WAN

    Originally, the sauvola thresholding was invented for text recognition like
    most of the niblack-like thresholding methods.

    Args:
        img (np.ndarray): image inputs
        method (str, optional): method to apply.
            Must be in ["niblack", "sauvola", "nick", "wolf"]. Defaults to "sauvola".

        k (float, optional): k factor. Defaults to 0.5.
